# Ideabox Group Project

#### A Project For Saving All The Brilliant Ideas

  *Work on this project has slowed or stopped completely. Deadline 3/02/2021, 9pm MST.*


## Learning Goals

* Gain an understanding of how to write clean `HTML` and `CSS` to match a provided comp
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using `localStorage`
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

## Overview

* Every developer has more ideas than time.  In this project, we'll be building an application that records and archives our ideas. Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on `javaScript` to implement filtering in the browser, and `localStorage` to persist our brilliant ideas between sessions.

## Set-up

* Create a repository and clone it to your local computer
* Open it in your text editor
* Read the `README.md`
* In the terminal run the command `open index.html` for initial deployment and interaction with app

## Functionality Goals

* Basic `JSON` and `localStorage` architecture in place inside the `Class` structure of a `data model` to best utilize `javaScript` to manage client-side interactions.
* The user should be able to add their own ideas and save them
* As a user one should be able to favorite and delete ideas
* `locaStorage` should be utilized to filter through saved, and deleted information from the search bar, to optimize user interface
* Employing another `class data model`, the user should be able to add comments to their idea cards, save those comments and access them for review at any time.
* The app should be functioning bug-free at each iteration of use
